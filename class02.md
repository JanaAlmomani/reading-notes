## In Python scripts, the if name == 'main'
statement is used to specify a section of code that will only be executed when the script is run directly as the main program, This allows you to separate code that is intended to be run directly from code that is meant to be reused in other programs.

## Recursive Functions in Python
A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result

## Python Modules and Packages
###  A Python Module can be a simple python File (. py extension file), a combination of numerous Functions and Global variables.

###  A Python Package is a collection of different Python modules with an __init__.py File

import the module in another program, use the import statement followed by the name of the module without the .py extension, and then use the dot notation to access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module.

To import a module from a package, use the dot notation to specify the package and module name, and then use the dot notation to access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module.
