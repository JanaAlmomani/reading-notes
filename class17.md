**_What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?_**

- Static websites have fixed content and structure, while dynamic websites generate content dynamically.
- Scraping static websites involves fetching and parsing HTML source code, while scraping dynamic websites requires executing JavaScript and interacting with the DOM.
- Dynamic websites often have interactive elements and may require simulating user interactions or handling AJAX requests.
- Scraping static websites can be done with basic web scraping tools, while scraping dynamic websites may require more advanced techniques and tools like headless browsers.
- Static websites are generally easier to scrape and require less maintenance, while dynamic websites are more prone to changes and may need regular updates to the scraping code.

**_Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites._**

- Respect robots.txt: Check the website's robots.txt file to understand crawling restrictions and follow the guidelines specified. Avoid scraping pages disallowed in robots.txt.

- Employ intelligent scraping: Limit request frequency to mimic human behavior, use realistic User-Agent headers, randomize IP addresses or use proxies, and maintain session information like cookies.

- Use scraping frameworks and libraries: Utilize established tools like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Selenium, which handle best practices such as asynchronous requests, parsing, JavaScript rendering, and form submissions.

**_What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial._**

In short, Playwright is an automation library that allows we to control web browsers programmatically. It assists in web scraping tasks by providing powerful capabilities to navigate web pages, interact with elements, and extract data. Playwright is particularly beneficial for scraping websites with dynamic content and complex JavaScript interactions. It supports modern web technologies and provides a high-level API for automating browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. With Playwright, we can automate the scraping process, including scrolling, extracting data from elements, and storing the scraped information for further processing.

**_Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage._**

XPath (XML Path Language) is a powerful query language used in web scraping to navigate and extract specific elements from HTML or XML documents. It allows us to traverse the structure of the document using path expressions and select nodes based on their attributes, tags, or position.

The purpose of using XPath in web scraping is to precisely target and extract specific elements from a webpage's HTML structure. It provides a flexible and reliable way to locate and retrieve data, even when the HTML markup or structure changes.
