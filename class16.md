**_What are the key characteristics of serverless computing,and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?_**

- Provisioning Time: Serverless computing has a significantly faster provisioning time, measured in milliseconds, compared to other models like PaaS, containers, and VMs, which can take minutes to hours for provisioning.

- Administrative Burden: Serverless computing has minimal administrative burden, whereas other models like PaaS, containers, and VMs have varying levels of administrative tasks, ranging from light to heavy.

- Maintenance: Serverless architectures are fully managed by the provider, requiring no maintenance tasks from the user. PaaS is also managed by the provider, but containers and VMs require significant maintenance, such as updating and managing operating systems, container images, and connections.

- Scaling: Serverless computing offers instant and inherent auto-scaling, including the ability to scale down to zero when there is no traffic. Other models provide automatic scaling but at a slower pace and require careful tuning of auto-scaling rules. They do not typically offer scaling down to zero.

- Capacity Planning: Serverless computing eliminates the need for capacity planning. Other models require a combination of automatic scalability and capacity planning to ensure sufficient resources.

- Statelessness: Serverless architectures are inherently stateless, ensuring scalability. State is stored in external services or resources. PaaS, containers, and VMs can maintain state through methods like HTTP, open sockets, or storing state in memory between calls.

- High Availability and Disaster Recovery: Serverless computing provides inherent high availability and disaster recovery without additional effort or cost. Other models require additional cost and management effort. VMs and containers can be automatically restarted in case of infrastructure failures.

- Resource Utilization: Serverless computing achieves 100% efficiency in resource utilization since it only consumes resources when invoked. Other models may have some degree of idle capacity, resulting in less efficient resource utilization.

- Billing Granularity and Savings: Serverless computing is typically metered in units of 100 milliseconds, providing fine-grained billing. PaaS, containers, and VMs are often metered by the hour or minute, offering less granular billing. Serverless can potentially lead to cost savings due to its pay-per-use model and efficient resource utilization.



**_What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?_**

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable developers to access and manipulate data or functionality provided by external sources, such as web services, databases, or online platforms.

In Python, APIs can be utilized to interact with external sources and retrieve data in a structured format, which can then be processed, analyzed, or used in various ways within your application. Here are the general steps to work with APIs in Python:

Understanding the API documentation: Start by reviewing the API documentation provided by the external source. It usually contains information about available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and usage limits.

Choosing an HTTP library: Python provides several HTTP libraries for making requests to APIs. Two commonly used libraries are the built-in urllib module and the popular third-party library requests. You can choose the library based on your preference and project requirements.

Making API requests: Use the chosen HTTP library to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. Typically, you'll make GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests to retrieve or modify data. Include any necessary parameters or headers based on the API documentation.

Handling the API response: Once you send the request, the API will respond with data in a specific format, such as JSON, XML, or CSV. Parse the response using appropriate methods provided by your chosen HTTP library. Convert the response into a suitable data structure, like dictionaries or lists, for further processing.

Manipulating and utilizing the data: Once you have retrieved the data from the API, you can manipulate it using Python's data processing and analysis tools. Extract the relevant information, perform calculations, filter or sort the data, and integrate it into your application as needed.

Error handling and resilience: API interactions may encounter errors, such as network issues, authentication problems, or incorrect data. Implement proper error handling mechanisms in your code to gracefully handle such situations and provide appropriate feedback to users.

Rate limiting and caching: Some APIs impose rate limits to prevent abuse. Respect the rate limits specified by the API provider and consider implementing caching mechanisms to avoid excessive requests and improve performance.


**_What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?_**

The Requests library is a popular Python library used for sending HTTP requests to APIs. It simplifies the process of interacting with APIs by providing a user-friendly interface. With Requests, you can easily make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP requests. Here's a basic example of a GET request using the Requests library:
    ```

        import requests

        response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(response.text)
        else:
            print('Error:', response.status_code)
    ```
In this example, import the requests library and use the get() function to send a GET request to the specified URL. We check the status_code attribute of the response object to ensure the request was successful, and then print the response content. If there was an error,  print the corresponding status code.
