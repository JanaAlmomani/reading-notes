 ## Pain and Suffering

1. Setting up the work environment

When you’re first starting out in Python, it’s important to set up all of the necessary environments. Doing this can be something of a challenge.

Strategy: To overcome this obstacle, beginners can use Python’s Integrated which makes it easy for you to install a single application. You can then perform every function within that single application.

2. Syntax

 Python's syntax can be confusing for beginners, particularly if they are new to programming. The use of whitespace and indentation to indicate code blocks, as well as the lack of semicolons or parentheses, can take some getting used to.

Strategy: To overcome this obstacle, beginners can start by breaking down the code into smaller parts, experimenting with them, and testing them. They can also use online resources such as tutorials, forums, and documentation to learn Python syntax and get feedback on their code.

3. name clashing with Python Standard Library Modules

This occurs when a user-defined name for a function, variable, or class clashes with a name already defined in the Python Standard Library. This can lead to errors in the code, making it difficult for beginners to understand and debug.

Strategy: To overcome this obstacle:

1.  Renaming user-defined names: To avoid name clashing with Python Standard Library Modules, beginners can choose to rename their user-defined names. This can be done by using a unique and descriptive name that is less likely to clash with the names defined in the Standard Library. They can also add a prefix or suffix to their user-defined names to make them more distinct and avoid conflicts.

2. Importing specific modules: Another strategy for avoiding name clashing is to import only the specific modules needed from the Python Standard Library. This is particularly important when using modules with common names, such as "math" or "random". Beginners can use the "import" statement to import only the required modules and give them unique names using an alias. For example, instead of using "import math", they can use "import math as my_math" to give the module a unique name.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

 Time complexity: the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity. However, the space and time complexity are also affected by  factors such as your operating system and hardware, but we are not including them in this discussion.

Now  time complexity example in which we’ll compare two different algorithms which are used to solve a particular problem.

## The Time complexity or Big O notations for some popular algorithms are listed below:

1. Binary Search: O(log n)
2. Linear Search: O(n)
3. Quick Sort: O(n * log n)
4. Selection Sort: O(n * n)
5. Travelling salesperson : O(n!)
6. Space complexity:

Space complexity is nothing but the amount of memory space that an algorithm or a problem takes during the execution of that particular problem/algo.

The space complexity is not only calculated by the space used by the variables in the problem/algo it also includes and considers the space for input values with it.

So we can say that space complexity is the combination or sum up of the auxiliary space and the space used by input values.
