**_Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?_**

Linear Regression in Machine Learning
Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.

**_Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Pythonâ€™s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions._**

Implementing a linear regression model in Python's Scikit Learn library involves several steps. Here is an overview of the process:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Separate the independent and dependent variables.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Create a linear regression model and fit it to the training data.
6. Predict the values using the test set.
7. Visualize the results.
8. Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
