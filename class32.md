## **_What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?_**

_Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions_ are a **set of built-in features that allow developers to control access to their APIs.** These permissions determine who can view, create, update, or delete resources in an API **based on predefined rules.**

### The **key** components of DRF permissions are:

1. **Permission Classes**: Permission classes are Python classes that `define the access control rules for an API view.` DRF provides several built-in permission classes that can be used to **restrict access to views**. **These classes are responsible for determining whether a request should be granted or denied access to a particular resource.**

2. **BasePermission**: BasePermission is a **base class** from which all permission classes should inherit. It `defines the basic methods that need to be implemented in a permission class`, such as **has_permission** and **has_object_permission**. These methods are called during the permission checking process.

3. **has_permission**: The has_permission method is **responsible for checking if a user has permission to access a particular API view.** It takes two parameters: request (the current request object) and view (the view object that is being accessed). `This method should return True if the request should be granted access, or False if the request should be denied access.`

4. **has_object_permission**: The has_object_permission method **is used to check if a user has permission to perform a specific action on a particular object.** It takes the same parameters as **has_permission** `in addition to obj (the object being accessed)`.

DRF permissions are used to restrict access to API views and ensure that only authorized users can conduct specified operations. T**hey contribute to API security by**:

1. Authentication: Permissions can be used to enforce authentication requirements, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected views. For example, the IsAuthenticated permission class allows access only to authenticated users.

2. Authorization: Permissions help in defining authorization rules, which determine what actions a user can perform on a resource. For instance, the IsAdminUser permission class restricts access to users with admin privileges.

3. Object-level Permissions: DRF permissions also support object-level permissions, enabling fine-grained control over access to individual objects. This ensures that a user can only perform actions on objects they have permission for.

4. Custom Permissions: DRF allows developers to create custom permission classes to implement specific access control logic tailored to their application's requirements. This flexibility enables developers to enforce domain-specific rules and restrictions.


## **_In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?_**

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. Its purpose is to specify the columns we want to fetch and the table from which we want to retrieve the data. To retrieve all columns from a table named 'employees', we will use the SELECT statement with the asterisk (*) wildcard symbol:

        SELECT * FROM employees;

This query will fetch all the columns from the 'employees' table, returning all the records stored in that table.

To retrieve specific columns from the 'employees' table, we would replace column1, column2, ... with the names of the desired columns. For example, if we want to retrieve the 'name' and 'salary' columns, the query would be:

        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;

        SELECT name, salary FROM employees;

## **_Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?_**

DRF Generic Views **are pre-implemented view classes in Django Rest Framework** that simplify the development of RESTful APIs. They handle common CRUD operations on models, such as listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting objects. By using these views, developers can reduce code duplication, promote code reuse, and accelerate API development. Examples include ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView, CreateAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView.
