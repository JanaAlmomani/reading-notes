**_Stacks and Queues:_**

 are two important data structures that are used in computer programming. They are both collections of elements, but they differ in terms of how the elements are added and removed from the collection.


A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous. 

that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates in a cafeteria: the last plate you put on the stack is the first one that you'll take off.
First-In-Last-Out (FILO) principle This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

In programming, elements are added to the stack using the "push" operation, and they are removed using the "pop" operation. The "top" of the stack refers to the element that was most recently added.

A Queue, on the other hand, follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Imagine a line of people waiting to buy tickets: the person who gets in line first is the one who gets served first.
Last-In-Last Out (LILO)  principle This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

In programming, elements are added to the back of the queue using the "enqueue" operation, and they are removed from the front of the queue using the "dequeue" operation.
Both Stacks and Queues are useful in a variety of programming contexts. For example, a stack can be used to implement an undo/redo feature in a text editor, while a queue can be used to process jobs in a job scheduler.
