**_Hash tables are powerful data structures used to store and retrieve data efficiently. They provide constant-time average-case complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, making them a fundamental tool in computer science. In this guide, we will explore the concept of hash tables, their implementation, and their various applications._**

What are Hash Tables?

- Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are data structures that enable efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.
- They are based on the concept of hashing, which involves mapping data to a fixed-size array using a hash function.

The Role of Hash Functions:

- A hash function takes an input (or key) and computes a unique hash value.
- The hash function maps the key to a specific index in the underlying array, called the hash code.
- Ideally, a good hash function evenly distributes the keys across the array to minimize collisions.

Handling Collisions:

- Collisions occur when two or more keys produce the same hash code.
- Two common approaches to handle collisions are separate chaining and open addressing.
- Separate chaining uses linked lists to store multiple values at the same hash code index.
- Open addressing involves finding an alternative position within the array to store the colliding value.
