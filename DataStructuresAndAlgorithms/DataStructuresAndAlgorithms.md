# Data Structures and Algorithms

##  What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

When selecting the appropriate data structure to solve a particular problem, it's crucial to analyze the requirements of the problem, the operations that will be performed (input and output), and consider the time and space efficiency of the structure. In addition, the size of the data and time and space complexity should also be taken into account.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Simply,  Apply a base condition to stop the recursion at a certain point.
