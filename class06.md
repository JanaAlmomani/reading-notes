## How to use Random Module ?

basically, The random module is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables. It can be used to perform some action randomly such as to get a random number, select a random element from a list, shuffle elements randomly, etc
## The random module has a set of methods:
- random()	: Returns a random float number between 0 and 1
- randrange()	Returns a random number between the given range
- randint()	Returns a random number between the given range,etc 

### Here simple example:
Use a random.randrange() function to get a random integer number from the given exclusive range by specifying the increment. For example, random.randrange(0, 10, 2) will return any random number between 0 and 20 (like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)

## What is Risk Analysis ?

Risk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential issues that could negatively impact key business initiatives or projects. 
This process is done in order to help organizations avoid or mitigate those risks.

## Risk Identification
There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

2. Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

3. Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

4. Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.

which determines whether our test cases are actually covering the application code and how much code is exercised when we run those test cases. If there are 10 requirements and 100 tests created and if 90 tests are executed then test coverage is 90%
