**_What are the key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project, according to the “Django Settings Best Practices” reading?_**

1. Separate settings for different environments.
2. Use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific settings.
3. Keep settings in separate modules for better organization.
4. Use a base settings module and override/add settings as needed.
5. Avoid absolute file paths and use relative or dynamic paths.
6. Exclude sensitive settings files from version control.
7. Document your settings for better understanding.
8. Follow Django's recommended settings structure.


**_How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?_**

1. Install White Noise using pip: pip install whitenoise
Add 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware' to the MIDDLEWARE setting in your Django project's settings file.
2. Add 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage' to the STATICFILES_STORAGE setting.
3. Configure the STATIC_ROOT directory in your settings file to specify the location where static files will be collected.
4. Run python manage.py collectstatic to collect all static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory.
5. Deploy your Django application, and White Noise will efficiently serve the static files.
